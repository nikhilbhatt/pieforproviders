# SPECIAL NOTES:
# 1.  GEM_HOME is set to the tmp/gem_home directory in this app.
#     Bundler is installed here.
#     If you delete Bundler from this directory, you will get an error
#     message about not having the correct version of bundler when you
#     run "bundle install" or try to do just about anything else.
# 2.  BUNDLE_PATH is set to the tmp/bundle directory in this app.
#     The products of "bundle install" are saved here.  If you delete
#     this directory, subsequent executions of the "bundle install"
#     process will take longer.
